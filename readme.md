# Introduction

Finally I had some time to practice the new version of NextJS, NextJS13 with this new features is awesome, from the new `/ app` directory to the Turbopack and much more!
As a user I always wanted a place where to write some notes and a list of tasks, for this I decided to create Operation-app!
I had an amazing opportunity to improve my skills with Prisma, GraphQL, Apollo, TailwindCSS, NextAuth, Vercel and React/NextJS13.
I'm really happy of the result, available also for mobile :)!
